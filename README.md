# About
This project is Udacity Front End Nanodegree's 5th Project. This map is my interest towards cricket. In this map you will find best cricket stadium locations in India. The map is also interactive in the sense that you can click on a location either from the list or on the map to learn a bit more about that place. I hope you enjoy!

## Displayed Content
When the app is first opened it will display a Google Map located in India, It shows all the 4 cricket stadium locations already marked. There will also be a small hamburger icon on top of the map that will slide a locations list and filter functionality.

## Features
1) With this app you can click on a marker and have more information about the location displayed to you. The selected marker will also bounce to stand out from the rest.

2) You can also click on the menu icon and choose a location from the list. The selected location will bounce on the map to let you know where it is located.

3) Along with the list options, you can also filter the list and display only certain markers on the list. For example, if you only want M. Chinnaswamy Stadium to appear, the filter would make the other markers disappear.

4) Simply click on the menu icon to make the filter/list disappear and have the map display in full screen.

5) Along with the name of the location on the marker, the infowindows also show a related wikipedia article on that place so you can learn more about each location.
